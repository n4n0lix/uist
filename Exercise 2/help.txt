Open the project file in "webcam2", then klick "run".

The project file is for Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 (you can download it for free from the Microsoft website).
If you want to use a different version, you may need to change some of the project settings.
It was tested under Windows 10.

If you want to use a different compiler or IDE, please install OpenCV 2.4.9 from
http://opencv.org/downloads.html
You just need to place the main.cpp file in your project and set the correct paths to the OpenCV files.

If it does not find the correct function definitions or DLLs: Change the paths to the folders in the project settings.

If it does not show a camera image after you start it, check that it can actually find a camera attached to the computer.
You may need to make sure in the device manager that the camera is properly installed.

If you notice that the Debug version (default) ist too slow, try choosing Release in the drop down menu.
You will not be able to use the debugger, but it will run significantly faster. If that does not help,
try to use a webcam with a higher frame rate.

If you still experience strange problems, feel free to send me an email or work on the high-end graphics workstations in the HCI lab.
